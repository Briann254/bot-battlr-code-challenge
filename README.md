## **Bot Battlr**

## **Description**
Welcome to Bot Battlr, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army!

This project is a React application that displays a list of available bots and allows users to add, release and discharge bots from their army.

## **Requirements**
Node.js
npm
JSON-server

## **Getting Started**
Clone the repository to your local machine
Run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies
Run npm start to start the development server
Run json-server --watch db.json to start the local JSON server
Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:3000/bots


## **Features**
See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection
Add an individual bot to your army by clicking on it. The bot can only be enlisted once and does not disappear from the BotCollection
Release a bot from your army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component
Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.
